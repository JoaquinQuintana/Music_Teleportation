# Project Proposal
Project title: "Musical Teleportation"

Team members' names:
  Timur Boskailo, 
  Joaquin Quintana, 
  Alex Thomas, 
  Samuel Steingard

Vision statement: "Instantaneously teleport to any location's music". Via a dropdown selection or location permissions, a region will be chosen. A playlist will then be automatically crafted based on this region which can use criteria such as locally popular songs, artist origins, or song material. 

Motivation:
- Combines interest of music and using a google map and/or Spotify API for our project (provides an opportunity to learn about API integration)
- Unique, dynamic experience (same location, different result)
- Manageable backend, to work on the challenge on the front end
- "Meditation" application, relaxing for end-user and exposes them to new music 

Risks to project completion:
- New language (backend language unknown)
- No experience working with team members
- No experience with Agile development
- Hit class and internal milestones

Mitigation Strategy for above risks:
- Learn Agile and use technique appropriately
- Good communication with team members
- Learn new languages

Development method:
- Agile with weekly scrums. We will be learning more about the Agile process during the process (see Risks)
- Project Tracking Software: Github Projects
